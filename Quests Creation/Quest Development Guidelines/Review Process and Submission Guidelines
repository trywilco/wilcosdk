# Review Process and Submission Guidelines

## Submitting your Quest for Review

When you submit a quest for review, it is important to **include a README file that includes a general overview of the quest and the textbook solution** (including all required action and code snippets required to complete the quest).  

For your convenience, we’ve prepared a [Quest Submission Checklist](https://www.notion.so/Quest-Submission-Checklist-eac5b59a16b7466784f348d7032bbd75) you can use to make sure your quest is ready for review. 

## Quest Review Process
